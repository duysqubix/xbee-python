Reporting a bug
---------------

The way to report bugs is to use the
`GitHub issue tracker <http://github.com/duysqubix/xbee-python/issues>`_.
Before reporting a bug, please read the following points:

#. Make sure that what you are seeing is really a bug by checking the
   `documentation <https://xbplib.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ and consulting 
   the `FAQs <https://xbplib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_ section.
#. If you still think you have found a bug, make sure someone has not already
   reported it. See the list of
   `known issues <http://github.com/duysqubix/xbee-python/issues>`_.
#. If it has not been reported yet, create a new issue. Make sure to add enough
   detail so that the bug can be reproduced.


Suggesting a new feature
------------------------

#. Consult the `FAQs <https://xbplib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_ 
   section to ensure that the behavior you would like the library to have is 
   not excluded.
#. Make sure someone has not already requested it. See the list of
   `known issues <http://github.com/duysqubix/xbee-python/issues>`_.
#. Submit your request in the issue tracker.
